This software is the glue between Nickolas Coplin's 64HDD and 
Roland Herman's PSID64.

STORY:
I´m a 64HDD user, and when I saw the development by R.H. I
wanted to use this nice little Program on my C64.
So I took one weekend off and wrote this small batchfile.

REQUIREMENTS:
You have to copy the DOS version PSID64.exe into your 64DD-systemdirectory, which
should be c:\64hdd\system\ 
(If not change it in the Program, it´s written in Basic, uncompiled)

USAGE:
Copy psid64.exe to the systemdir of 64hdd.
On C64 side run the psid18.prg file.
LFN must be turned on or filenames have to be in 8.3 format.

WHAT DOES IT DO?
64hdd can call dos programms for crosscompiling. 
psid64hdd copies the selected sidfile to your 64hdd systemdir, compiles 
it and loads it.
you can do it by hand if you want! (see lines 56-64) 

IMPORTANT:
Use the DOS Version of psid64.exe (within this zipfile) not the 
'usual' win-version.

SPECIAL THANKS TO:
R.H. for compiling psid64 *just for this project* in DOS 
& N.C. for providing the file on his HP.
